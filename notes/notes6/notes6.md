# Using Wildcards and Brace Expansion 

## 1. Asterisk Wildcard (`*`)
**Definition**: The asterisk (`*`) wildcard matches any number of characters, including no characters, in a file or directory name.

**Examples**:
- List all files in a directory regardless of name or extension:
  ```bash
  ls *
  ```
- List all hidden files in a directory(excluding the parent directory):
  ```bash
  ls .??*
  ```
- list files that start with "pizza" and end in any extension:
  ```bash
  ls pizza*
  ```

## 2. Question Mark Wildcard (`?`)
**Definition**: The question mark (`?`) wildcard matches exactly one character in a filename or directory name.

**Examples**:
- List files with names that are exactly 4 characters long and have a `.exe` extension:
  ```bash
  ls ????.exe
  ```
- List files that start with "a" followed by a single character and end in `.log`:
  ```bash
  ls a?.log
  ```
- List files with extensions that are exactly 3 characters long:
  ```bash
  ls *.???
  ```

## 3. Bracket Wildcard (`[]`)
**Definition**: The bracket (`[]`) wildcard matches any one of the characters within the brackets in the file or directory name. You can also specify ranges within the brackets.

**Examples**:
- List files that contain "a", "b" or any number and end in `.txt`:
  ```bash
  ls *[ab0-9]*.txt
  ```
- List files that start with "a" and cannot contain numbers before the extension:
  ```bash
  ls a*[!0-9].*
  ```
- List files that cannot start with uppercase letters and end in `.sh`:
  ```bash
  ls [!A-Z]*.sh
  ```
- List files that contain punctuation sign:
  ```bash
  ls *[[:punct:]]*.sh
  ```

## 4. Brace Expansion (`{}`)
**Definition**: Brace expansion allows you to generate a series of names by specifying comma-separated values or ranges within braces (`{}`). Itâ€™s commonly used to create multiple files or directories at once.

**Examples**:
- Create multiple files with different extensions in one command:
  ```bash
  touch file.{txt,doc,pdf}
  ```
- Generate a sequence of numbered directories:
  ```bash
  mkdir dir_{1..3}
  ```
- List files with names that start with either "fileA", "fileB", or "fileC":
  ```bash
  ls file{A,B,C}.txt
  ```
